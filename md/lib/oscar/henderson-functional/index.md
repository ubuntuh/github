# Functional Programming - Application and Implementation by Peter Henderson

- 1980 年に出版された本である。
- p. x - My belief is that a fuller understanding of the semantics of functional languages, and by extension all programming languages, is developed if one studies the connections between the languages and their implementations. To ensure that all the connections are established, the book includes a complete description of an implementation of a purely functional language called Lispkit Lisp.
- p. 1 - High-level languages such as Fortran, Algol, Cobol, PL/1 and Pascal were developed.
- p. 2 - *domain* of the function and the *range* of the function
- p. 3 - We say that *f* maps *x* to *f(x)* or that *f(x)* is the image of *x* under *f*. More common usage in computing is to say that *f(x)* is the result of applying *f* to the argument *x*.
- p. 7 - ... *applicative language*. Here, we shall refer to it as a *purely functional language*.
- p. 10 - That is to say, we are *computing by effect* rather than just *computing values*.
- p. 13 - This form of data, which is usually called "S-expressions" (S for "symbolic"), has the advantage of being very simple but very general.

- p. ix - Since changing shells is as easy as changing hats, ...
- Bourne Again shell (bash), Korn shell (ksh), tektronix C shell (tcsh)
- `echo $BASH_VERSION`
- p. 1 - Ultrix, AIX, Xenix, SunOS, Linux

- p. 3 - Stephen R. Bourne
- p. 5 - `echo $SHELL`

    - regular files, executable files, directories
- p. 8 - full pathname = absolute pathname
- p. 9 - working directory = current directory

- home directory = login directory
- cd, pwd
- p. 11 - MS-DOS and VAX/VMS users should note that there is *nothing special* about the dot (.) in UNIX filenames (aside from the leading dot, which "hides" the file); it's just another character. For example, `ls *` lists all files in the current directory; you don't need `*.*` as you do on other systems. Indeed, `ls *.*` won't list all the files---only those that have at least one dot in the middle of the name.
- p. 13 - However, it's important to be aware that the commands that you run only see the results of wildcard expansion.
- p. 14 - `echo b{ed,olt,ar}s`
- standard input, standard output, standard error (output)
